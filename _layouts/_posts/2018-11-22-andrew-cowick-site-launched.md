I put this website together to learn how to use GitHub Pages. I am hoping to put links to my projects on here as well as my resume, etc.
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
I am hoping to put up web pages that I made in HTML and stylized with CSS on this website in order to show my web design experience.
