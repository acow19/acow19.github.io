  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>My Technical Side</h2>
  <p>I was first exposed to "programming" when I was a sophmore in high school and took a fundamentals of web design class.
  I put "programming" in quotes because the first languages I learned were the markup language, HTML, as well as CSS. Even though they were
  quite simple to learn, I fell in love! I wanted to study more and I defintly wanted to take the advaced web design course. My web design teacher called me a perfectionist because my websites always looked exactly like the examples that we were supposed to follow. I think
  what made me fall in love with HTML was that HTML, Notepad++, and Adobe DreamWeaver were the first tools that allowed me to make my own
  web pages. At that point I wanted to be a web designer. This is when I started to understand that I like to make and design things. I want to
  be able to see that I created something and that I am able to make something that others can see, use, as well as understand.
  I like to see things from the user's perspective and try to make webpages simple for users to use, as well as pleasing to look at.</p>
  
  <p>Growing up, I learned that I wanted to be a computer programmer or a software engineer. I took an AP computer science class when i was
  junior in high school. This is when I started to pick up and like Java. I am glad I took that class because I already knew pretty much 
  everything going into my CS 1301 class during the fall of my freshman year of college. Since then, I have learned about C++ and C. At the time
  of writing this I am curretly learning Oracle SQL. I have used Visual Studio 2017 to program in C++ and C.</p>
  
  <p>I call myself an Android enthusiast. I love the Android operating system. I have gone through some tutorials about how to make Android
  applications using Android Studio. I like making Android apps because I love the operating system, and the main programming language that
  Android apps are programmed in is Java. The fact that Android apps are mainly made in Java makes the process much simpiler since I already
  have an intermediate level knowldedge of Java. I also keep up with the newest Android phones, software updates, as well as updates
  that are important to Andorid developers.</p>
  
  <p>As the title of my website says, I am an aspiring professional programmer. I am hoping one day to either become a software engineer, a web
  developer, a front-end developer, an android developer, or something similar. I want to do work that I can be able to see that I physically ( or I guess
  really digitally) created something and that makes an impact. The impact does not have to be on the entire world, but if my work can make an impact
  or improve or make one person's life easier, than I will be happy. I want to learn more about programming and learn more programming languages,
  while also learning more about the programming languages that I already know.</p>
