  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>My Technical Side</h2>
  <p>I was first exposed to "programming" when I was a sophmore in high school and took a fundamentals of web design class.
  I put "programming" in quotes because the first languages I learned were the markup language, HTML, as well as CSS. Even though they were
  quite simple to learn, I fell in love! I wanted to study more and I defintly wanted to take the advaced web design course. My web design teacher called me a perfectionist because my websites always looked exactly like the examples that we were supposed to follow. I think
  what made me fall in love with HTML was that HTML, Notepad++, and Adobe DreamWeaver were the first tools that allowed me to make my own
  web pages. At that point I wanted to be a web designer. This is when I started to understand that I like to make and design things. I want to
  be able to see that I created something and that I am able to make something that others can see, use, as well as understand.
  I like to see things from the user's perspective and try to make webpages simple for users to use, as well as pleasing to look at.</p>
  
  <p>Growing up, I learned that I wanted to be a computer programmer or a software engineer. I took an AP computer science class when i was
  junior in high school. This is when I started to pick up and like Java. I am glad I took that class because I already knew pretty much 
  everything going into my CS 1301 class during the fall of my freshman year of college. Since then, I have learned about C++ and C. At the time
  of writing this I am curretly learning Oracle SQL. I have used Visual Studio 2017 to program in C++ and C.</p>
  
  <p>I call myself an Android enthusiast. I love the Android operating system. I have gone through some tutorials about how to make Android
  applications using Android Studio. I like making Android apps because I love the operating system, and the main programming language that
  Android apps are programmed in is Java. The fact that Android apps are mainly made in Java makes the process much simpiler since I already
  have an intermediate level knowldedge of Java. I also keep up with the newest Android phones, software updates, as well as updates
  that are important to Andorid developers.</p>
  
  <p>As the title of my website says, I am an aspiring professional programmer. I am hoping one day to either become a software engineer, a web
  developer, a front-end developer, an android developer, or something similar. I want to do work that I can be able to see that I physically ( or I guess
  really digitally) created something and that makes an impact. The impact does not have to be on the entire world, but if my work can make an impact
  or improve or make one person's life easier, than I will be happy. I want to learn more about programming and learn more programming languages,
  while also learning more about the programming languages that I already know.</p>

  <h2>My Non-Technical Side</h2>
  
  <p>Running is one of my hobbies. Actually, running is more than just a hobby to me, it is a sport that has been a big part of my life.
  I have been running competitively since I was in 7th grade. I learned to love cross country when I was a freshman in high school.
  In fact, I learnd to love it so much that at the time of writing this, I am on a varsity cross country team at my college.
  I am defintly not the fastest person on my team but I love what I am doing and running for myself, as well as for my teammates is one
  of the reasons that I get up in the morning. Running makes me feel like I am a part of something that is bigger than myself.
  Running sets a daily routine for me all on its own. I run at least six days a week and have practice twice a day for five days a week. I run for about 48 out of 52 weeks in a year. I get one, or maybe if I'm lucky, two weeks off in between seasons.
  I hope to continue running road races as well as for enjoyment after I graduate college. Running is something that I don't think I will
  stop doing anytime soon.</p>
  
  <p>If you were to ask me to describe my music taste in one playlist, I would say that my music taste is very similar to
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXajgUqadhHiB">The I.T. Crowd Playlist on Spotify.</a> I was raised on music
  from the 70s, 80s, and 60s. I really like any music that sounds like oldies or that has a really good bass. My love for bass, as well as 
  my love for videogames is probalby what made me fall in love with electronic music. I listen to a lot of house music. By house
  music I mean a little bit of everything, from Chicago house, to electro house, future house, progressive house, to disco house. If you were
  to ask me what my favorite genre of today's music is, I would say that it is Nu Disco. Nu Disco is a niche genre that is electronic music
  that somewhat sounds like 70s and 80s disco. As you could guess, it is right up my alley! This is also probably due to my love of my favorite
  band, Daft Punk. I fell in love with thier French house, and disco sound. Some of my other favorite artists and bands include deadmau5, 
  Disclosure, A-P Connection, Satin Jackets, Breakbot, and Chromeo to name a few.</p>
